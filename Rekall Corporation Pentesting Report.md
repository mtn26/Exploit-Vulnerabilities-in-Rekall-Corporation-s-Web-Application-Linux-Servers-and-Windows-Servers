  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>In accordance with Rekall policies, our organization conducts external and internal penetration tests of its networks and systems throughout the year. The purpose of this engagement was to assess the networks’ and systems’ security and identify potential security flaws by utilizing industry-accepted testing methodology and best practices.
</p>
<p>For the testing we focused on the following:</p>
<p>- Attempting to determine what system-level vulnerabilities could be discovered and exploited with no prior knowledge of the environment or notification to administrators.
     
<p>- Attempting to exploit vulnerabilities found and access confidential information that may be stored on systems.</p>
   
<p>- Documenting and reporting on all findings</p>

</p>

<p>All tests took into consideration the actual business processes implemented by the systems and their potential threats; therefore, the results of this assessment reflect a realistic picture of the actual exposure levels to online hackers. This document contains the results of that assessment.
</p>

<h2>Assessment Objective</h2>

<p>The primary goal of this assessment was to provide an analysis of security flaws present in Rekall’s web applications, networks, and systems. This assessment was conducted to identify exploitable vulnerabilities and provide actionable recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities to provide a greater level of security for the environment.
</p>
<p>We used our proven vulnerability testing methodology to assess all relevant web applications, networks, and systems in scope. 
</p>
<p>Rekall has outlined the following objectives:
</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Find and exfiltrate any sensitive information within the domain</th>
    <th>Escalate privileges</th>
    <th>Compromise several machines</th>
     </tr>

<h1>Pentesting Methodology</h1>
<h2>Reconnaissance</h2>
<p>We begin assessments by checking for any passive (open source) data that may assist the assessors with their tasks. If internal, the assessment team will perform active recon using tools such as Nmap and Bloodhound.
</p>
<h2>Identification of Vulnerabilities and Services</h2>
<p>We use custom, private, and public tools such as Metasploit, hashcat, and Nmap to gain perspective of the network security from a hacker’s point of view. These methods provide Rekall with an understanding of the risks that threaten its information, and also the strengths and weaknesses of the current controls protecting those systems. The results were achieved by mapping the network architecture, identifying hosts and services, enumerating network and system-level vulnerabilities, attempting to discover unexpected hosts within the environment, and eliminating false positives that might have arisen from scanning. 
</p>
<h2>Vulnerability Exploitation</h2>
<p>Our normal process is to both manually test each identified vulnerability and use automated tools to exploit these issues. Exploitation of a vulnerability is defined as any action we perform that gives us unauthorized access to the system or the sensitive data. 
</p>
<h2>Reporting</h2>
<p>Once exploitation is completed and the assessors have completed their objectives, or have done everything possible within the allotted time, the assessment team writes the report, which is the final deliverable to the customer.
</p>

<h1>Scope</h1>
<p>Prior to any assessment activities, Rekall and the assessment team will identify targeted systems with a defined range or list of network IP addresses. The assessment team will work directly with the Rekall POC to determine which network ranges are in-scope for the scheduled assessment. 

It is Rekall’s responsibility to ensure that IP addresses identified as in-scope are actually controlled by Rekall and are hosted in Rekall-owned facilities (i.e., are not hosted by an external organization). In-scope and excluded IP addresses and ranges are listed below. 
</p>

<h1>Executive Summary of Findings</h1>

<h2>Grading Methodology</h2>
<p>Each finding was classified according to its severity, reflecting the risk each such vulnerability may pose to the business processes implemented by the application, based on the following criteria:
</p>

<p> 
 
  - Very High: Immediate threat to key business processes.
 
  - High: Indirect threat to key business processes/threat to secondary business processes.
  
  - Medium: Indirect or partial threat to business processes. 
  
  - Low: No direct threat exists; vulnerability may be leveraged with other vulnerabilities.
  
   - Very Low:    No threat; however, the data may be used in a future attack.
</p>

<p>As the following grid shows, each threat is assessed in terms of both its potential impact on the business and the likelihood of exploitation:</p>

<h2>Summary of Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>

<p>While the assessment team was successful in finding several vulnerabilities, the team also recognized several strengths within Rekall’s environment. These positives highlight the effective countermeasures and defenses that successfully prevented, detected, or denied an attack technique or tactic from occurring. 
</p>

<h3>Strengths</h3>

<p>Some of the strengths that Team Habibi found were mitigations found in place for denial of DDOS Attacks to ensure network availability. No vulnerable open source data penetration due to mapping network architecture. The tools like Metasploit are utilized to prevent unauthorized access. Current and continuing penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities for mitigation
</p>

<h3>Weaknesses</h3>

<p>Team Habibi found several vulnerabilities that should be immediately addressed to prevent an adversary from compromising the network. These findings are not specific to a software version but are more general and systemic vulnerabilities. Most of the vulnerabilities were dealt with injections(command, SPL,cross-site) in Rekall’s web app, and exploits in the Linux OS and Windows OS.
</p>

<h1>Executive Summary</h1>

<p>During the penetration testing of Rekall’s IT assets, Team Habibi identified multiple vulnerabilities that can damage Rekall’s reputation. Team Habibi was able to infiltrate Rekall’s assets, exfiltrate sensitive data, and escalate privileges within systems, as seen below. 


Team Habibi tested Rekall’s Web Application first. We determined it was vulnerable to an XSS Reflected attack as the malicious script can be run on the home page. The Web App was also vulnerable to Local File Inclusion as files can be uploaded from the VR Planner web page. An XSS Stored vulnerability was identified on the Comments page as it allows scripting code to be run. SQL Injection attacks can also be run on the Login.php toolbar, and the Networking.php page is vulnerable to a Command Injection attack.

Within the Linux environment, Team Habibi found stolen credentials were used to access one host and escalate privileges to root. An additional common known shell RCE execution vulnerability was discovered using Meterpreter. The sudoers file was accessible using a Shellshock exploit in Metasploit as well. Open source data was determined to be exposed and viewable using OSINT, and searching crt.sh showed a stored certificate. The Apache server was found to be out-of-date, with a Struts vulnerability.

The Windows OS environment was tested next, and Team Habibi discovered that FTP Port 110 was open and vulnerable, and which is used for the SLMail service. We Used Metasploit vulnerability, as well as to gain access to a password hash file which was subsequently cracked and enabled the creation of a reverse shell. 
In summary, these vulnerabilities could be exploited maliciously to cause massive damage to the assets and the functionality of the business. Team Habibi has provided detailed recommendations for mitigating each of these vulnerabilities to prevent harm and loss that could result.
