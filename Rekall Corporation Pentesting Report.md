  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>In accordance with Rekall policies, our organization conducts external and internal penetration tests of its networks and systems throughout the year. The purpose of this engagement was to assess the networks’ and systems’ security and identify potential security flaws by utilizing industry-accepted testing methodology and best practices.
</p>
<p>For the testing we focused on the following:</p>
<p>- Attempting to determine what system-level vulnerabilities could be discovered and exploited with no prior knowledge of the environment or notification to administrators.
     
<p>- Attempting to exploit vulnerabilities found and access confidential information that may be stored on systems.</p>
   
<p>- Documenting and reporting on all findings</p>

</p>

<p>All tests took into consideration the actual business processes implemented by the systems and their potential threats; therefore, the results of this assessment reflect a realistic picture of the actual exposure levels to online hackers. This document contains the results of that assessment.
</p>

<h2>Assessment Objective</h2>

<p>The primary goal of this assessment was to provide an analysis of security flaws present in Rekall’s web applications, networks, and systems. This assessment was conducted to identify exploitable vulnerabilities and provide actionable recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities to provide a greater level of security for the environment.
</p>
<p>We used our proven vulnerability testing methodology to assess all relevant web applications, networks, and systems in scope. 
</p>
<p>Rekall has outlined the following objectives:
